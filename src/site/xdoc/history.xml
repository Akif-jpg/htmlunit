            <p>
                Back around 2001, Mike Bowler was working with an eXtreme Programming (XP) team at one of his clients.
                The team was building a web application and wanted to write automated unit and acceptance tests but at that time,
                they didn't have the browser automation tools that are available today.
                The one tool that could be found, only simulated the HTTP protocol and not the interaction of the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                So Mike got annoyed with the lack of tooling and created HtmlUnit to fill that gap. Starting with just
                simple form handling and page interaction, HtmlUnit grew to support JavaScript so that it could truly simulate
                what the page would do in a real browser.
                While developement started off slow, with just one person working on it, HtmlUnit has grown to have an engaged community.
                Its current success is due to the huge contributions from people we've never even met in person.
