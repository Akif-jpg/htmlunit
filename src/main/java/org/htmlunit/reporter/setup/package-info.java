/**
 * Manages the setup and configuration of components necessary for the test recording system.
 *
 * <p>The primary responsibility of this package is to prepare the environment required by the recording mechanism
 * before or at the start of test execution. This typically includes:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Configuring the HtmlUnit {@link com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.WebClient} object for specific recording behaviors
 *         (e.g., JavaScript logging, AJAX call tracking, saving web responses).</li>
 *     <li>Reading and loading recording settings (e.g., output format, recording directory) from external sources
 *         (environment variables, configuration files).</li>
 *     <li>Performing necessary initial setup for factory classes like {@link com.yourcompany.testrecorder.recorder.RecorderFactory}.</li>
 *     <li>Other setup or preparation tasks that can be shared between tests.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Classes in this package aim to keep test code cleaner, centralize setup logic, and create reusable configuration
 * profiles (presets) for different test scenarios. They are typically used by test execution mechanisms in the
 * {@code com.yourcompany.testrecorder.runner} package or by methods like {@code @BeforeAll}, {@code @BeforeEach} in test classes.</p>
 *
 * <p>To provide configuration flexibility, design patterns like the Builder pattern in classes such as
 * {@link com.yourcompany.testrecorder.webclient.RecordingWebClientBuilder} can be utilized.</p>
